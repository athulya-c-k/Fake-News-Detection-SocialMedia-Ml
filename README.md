#  Fake News Identification System using SocialMedia Data

##  Project Overview
The increasing reliance on online platforms for news consumption has resulted in the rapid spread of misinformation. This project focuses on building a text-based classification system that can differentiate between authentic and fabricated news content using statistical and linguistic features.

---

##  Purpose of the Project
- To understand the role of NLP in text classification
- To build a supervised machine learning model for fake news detection
- To evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- To create a simple application for real-time prediction

---

##  Technical Stack
-  Python  
-  Pandas, NumPy  
-  TF-IDF  
-  Logistic Regression  
-  Pickle  
-  Streamlit  

---

##  Dataset Description
- **Source:** ISOT Fake News Dataset  
- **Components:** Two datasets containing real and fake news articles  
- The dataset was used only for training and testing and is not uploaded to this repository.

---

##  Methodology
1. Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, normalization)
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
3. Model training with labeled data
4. Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
5. Deployment through a web-based interface

---

##  Performance Summary
The trained model achieved an overall accuracy of approximately **98%**, indicating strong classification capability for both real and fake news articles.

##  Running the Application

### Install Required Packages

### Launch the Streamlit App

---

## ystem Output
The application accepts user-entered news text and classifies it as:
- **Real News**
- **Fake News**

A confidence score is also displayed to support the prediction result.

##  Example Inputs

**Sample Genuine News Input**
According to official government sources, the policy reform will be implemented in phases...


---

##  Constraints
- Best suited for English news articles
- May not perform well on extremely short inputs
- Social media slang may reduce accuracy

---

##  Future Scope
- Incorporating deep learning architectures
- Expanding to multilingual datasets
- Improving robustness for social media content
- Integration with browser extensions
